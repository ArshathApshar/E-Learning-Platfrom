            <p><b>What does a developer need from a learning platform?</b><br>
                            The debate over video vs. text-based learning is not new. There are many voices that argue for one or the other. Strangely, studies show that there is little statistical difference in memorization between the two approaches.
            
            So, does that mean that there is no difference between text-based or video lecture learning? No!
            
            Studies like these fail to address the actual needs of a developer who is learning online. Just because there is little difference in stats doesn’t mean the the approaches are equally effective for someone learning computer science online.
            
            The conversation has to start with the developer’s needs. Online learning is not a one-size-fits-all experience. Subject matter plays the largest role in determining the most effective learning experience. Different subjects have different outcomes.
            
            So, what are the needs of online learners in the tech space? Which method best accommodates those needs? Let’s assess them before comparing video and text in depth. <br>
            
            
            <b>Developers need hands-on practice</b> <br>
            The efficiency of an online learning method (text or video) comes down to the outcome of the subject matter at hand. If the goal is simply rote memorization, the means to that end goal will be different than, say, building a software program.
            
            We know that developers want practical competency. Developers learning online are trying to reproduce certain outcomes within their own circumstances by building projects, designing software, and debugging.
            
            This means that hands-on practice is essential to the success of an online learner in the software space. In other words, developers need a learning experience that allows you to learn the content and immediately put that content into practice.
            
            In fact, a meta-study that looked at 57 different studies on learning found that hands-on learners performed 20% better than students who learned with only an auditory lecture. Hands-on practice is essential.
            
            
            Developers need mixed media (visualizations for theory, interactive application, etc.)
            Learning how to code includes more than just memorization. You need a mix of theory, visuals, metaphor, language translation, and practical application. When you learn how to code, you need to understand things at various levels, like: <br>
     <div class="point">
            <b>How a piece of code will manifest in the real-world <br>
            How a piece of code is understood by a computer <br>
            How a piece of code can be written in other programming languages <br>
            How theory makes a piece code possible <br>
            Learning software development needs to trigger multiple parts of the brain. This means that mixed media is necessary to accommodate all of these different facets. Otherwise, a lesson won’t be useful or applicable. A developer needs visuals and metaphors for complex theory, interactive examples to see how the code interacts with itself, and more.</b> <br></div>
            
            
            <b>Developers need multiple, real-world examples</b><br>
            As I mentioned before, the outcome of learning software development is to reproduce results in different contexts. You learn the theory of, say, a linked list, and then apply that to different data sets. Same results, different situations.
            
            This means that developers need real-world examples to solidify their knowledge and determine when/why to apply certain skills. Using only one example teaches you only one potential application.
            
            The best software development instruction offers multiple examples of increasing complexity that demonstrate how to reproduce the outcomes and when to apply that knowledge in other circumstances.
            
            
            Developers need control over the learning pace
            Studies show that the most successful learning experiences are those where the learner has control over the pace. People understand things at different rates and for different reasons. Developers especially need to learn at their own pace</p>
